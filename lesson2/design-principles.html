          This screenshot portrays the design element of visual hierarchy well.
          The cake draws the eye first with all of it fun bright colors. The hat
          on the cake points up leading my eye to the large heading right above
          it ("Bundt Cakes and More!"). Then my eye goes down to the the page to
          the colored text area where I then look next at the bolder, all
          uppercase "Birthday" heading and then continues down the image to the
          white "Shop Birthdays" button. The use of color, and different font
          size and weight contribute to the visual hierarchy of this page.

          This screenshot has a good amount of white space and has a clean and
          simple design. The text has good margins on all sides and the images
          focal point is slightly off center allowing for more white space on
          the right side. The left-alignment of the text makes for a nice clean
          design. This screenshot image is not overcrowded and there is plenty
          of space for the viewerâ€™s eye to rest.

          The neat left-alignment of the heading and body text along with edge
          of the smaller blue boxes is very evident in this screenshot. The
          icons, in the large blue heading boxes, are aligned with each other on
          the right side of the screen. Like items are aligned with each in each
          section making this design neat and clean.
